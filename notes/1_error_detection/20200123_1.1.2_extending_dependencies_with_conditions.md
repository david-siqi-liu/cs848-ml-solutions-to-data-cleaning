7. Justification of Decision (one paragraph)

This paper introduces Conditional Inclusion Dependencies (CINDs), an extension to the traditional inclusion dependencies (INDs). It largely follows the same format as 1.1.2, the paper which introduced CFDs. Unlike CFDs vs FDs, CINDs are always consistent and finitely axiomatizable. However, if we put CINDs and CFDs together, the consistency problem becomes undecidable. Compared to 1.1.2, this paper had clearer presentations and notations, easier to understood examples. Overall, CINDs are quite closely related to CFDs, although not identical, it's not as novice. It's also difficult to implement the heuristic method stated in the paper to check for consistencies between CINDs and CFDs. Therefore, my final rating is "weak accept".

# Notes

- Inclusion: subset of one another
- If we make the tableau interesting (e.g., include UDFs), inference system becomes screwed up
