7. Justification of Decision (one paragraph)

This paper extends the idea of Probabilisitic Unclean Databases (PUDs) and introduces two models - prepresentation model and noisy channel generation model, that can be learned effectively using data augmentation. Specifically, it uses supervised, labelled correct dataset to learn transformations which can be used to create new dataset to train the classifer (e.g., neural network). There are a ton of notations and models used in the paper, so in the absence of concrete examples, the concepts became hard to grasp. There's also unclean distinction between module 2 (learnable layer model) and module 3 (classifier). Overall, I give this paper an accept since the idea is highly novel.


8. Detailed comments (please number each comment) 

- Would be good to give an example of augmentating functional dependency, instead of just manipulation of strings
