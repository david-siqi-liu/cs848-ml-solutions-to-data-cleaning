7. Justification of Decision (one paragraph)

Recognizing inefficiencies in current algorithms for FD discovery, this paper presents a 2-phase approach. In essence, the first phase selects a subset of records and calcualtes the FDs of these samples. The second phase, takes in the FD candidates from the first phase, and checks if they hold on the entire dataset, thus making them FDs. Together, this is efficient both column-wise and row-wise. Overall, I find the improvements in efficiency produced the algorithm to be useful, and has the potential to be applied to other data cleaning algorithms. However, due to the fact that this paper does not introduce any novel way of identify the FDs, or checking the FDs, I give this a "weak accept" rating.
