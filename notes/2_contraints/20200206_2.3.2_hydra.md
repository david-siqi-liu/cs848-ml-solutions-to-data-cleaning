7. Justification of Decision (one paragraph)

This paper expands on the idea presented in "a hybrid approach to functional dependency discovery", from FD to DC in general. Unlike FDs, DCs contain inequality predicates, which make them a lot more complex. The underlying ideas are similar - sample a subset of tuples, discover predicate candidates, and check on complete dataset. In addition, the algorithm proposed by this paper has "linear growth time", which is much better than the exponential in current state-of-the-art algorithms. Overall, I give this paper a "accept" rating.
