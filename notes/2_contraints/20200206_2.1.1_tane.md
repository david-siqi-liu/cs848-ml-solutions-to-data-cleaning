7. Justification of Decision (one paragraph)

This is the first paper that introduced the bottom-up approach of identifying FDs in a dataset. While it might not be efficient today, it was definitely novel and comprehensive when it was published in 1999. As the paper itself has pointed out, this algorithm scales poorly with the number of columns (i.e., not column-efficient). It's difficult to imagine that this kind of intensive pruning was achieveable back in 1999. Since this is first of its kind, there's no comparison benchmark for performance. Overall, I give this paper a rating of "accept".
