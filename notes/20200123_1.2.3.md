7. Justification of Decision (one paragraph)

This paper tries to tackle the decoupling problem in data cleaning - that instead of changing errorneous target, we should identify the (most plausible) errorneous source set of records and repair them. To do this, this paper formally separates and defines the "description" and "prescription" processes, formulates ways to compute CSVs and RSVs, proposes two methods (local vs global) of assigning scores (likelihoods of errors). Lastly, it conducts three independent experiments on the TPC-H benchmark generated data. Overall, this paper has good presentations, clear and easy-to-understood notations, well-defined algorithms and objective functions. Most importantly, it formalizes the decoupling problem, so my overall rating for this paper is "strong accept".


8. Detailed comments (please number each comment) 

- What happens if, by removing the error tuples, more violations are introduced? Would the process be iterative?
