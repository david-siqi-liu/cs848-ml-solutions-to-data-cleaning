7. Justification of Decision (one paragraph)

This paper presents an approximation algorithm that produces a a set of repairs (value modifications) that is within constant factor of the optimum repair distance. It is novel, even though it makes simplified assumptions (e.g., same weights for all tuples), it provides a good starting pointing for future repair work. Generally I find the presentation to be lacking, especially for step 2 of the algorithm (resolving new violations). There's also no experimental study in this paper. In light of these, I give it a weak accept rating.


8. Detailed comments (please number each comment) 

- I am still confused about the difference between "finding a polynomial time approximation scheme for the Optimum Repair problem" and "finding a repair algorithm that runs in polynomial time and produces a V-repair whose distance to the input distance is within a constant factor of the optimum repair distance". The former has been shown to be impossible in the paper, while the latter is the main contribution of the paper
- Hyperedges in the example seems to be incorrect/unclear - c_1 is not included in the triple conflict, and it's unclear how CD to E is reflected in the hypergraph
- Core implicants is not clearly defined - would be good to have some examples
- No experimental study
