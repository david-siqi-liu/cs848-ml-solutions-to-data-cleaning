7. Justification of Decision (one paragraph)

This paper proposes a novel approach to the problem of identifying and repairing domain value constraint errors. It uses boosting techniques (e.g., AdaBoost) to help software engineers identify errors (in both training and testing sets) and automatically repair them (using imputation methods) so that the model has high accuracy scores. However, since this approach's metric is the model's test metric, it's worth noting that it is also one of the drawbacks of this approach, which is that we can empirically evaluate BoostClean's effectiveness without using the model, which if changes, means that the result also changes. Nevertheless, this simple approach yields great results, and I give this appraoch an accept rating.
