7. Justification of Decision (one paragraph)

This paper introduces a holistic data reparing framework that utilizes (internal) integrity constraints (given, not learned), external dictionaries (given, not learned) and quantitative statics of the dataset (learned) to make probabilistic repairs. It uses factor-graph to incorporate all of the constraints, and attempts to tackle the scale problem of grounding by introducing clever pruning techniques (e.g., co-occurrance). The framework is quite novel as it is indeed holistic and does not limit itself to just one type of error. It also makes probabilistic inference as opposed to determinisitc ones. Overall, I give it an Accept rating.


8. Detailed comments (please number each comment) 

- For co-occurrance with c, how do we know c' is clean? If c' is not clean, then co-occurrance is meaningless, and we cannot prune the graph based on it.
