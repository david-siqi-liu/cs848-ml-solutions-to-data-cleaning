7. Justification of Decision (one paragraph)

Unlike HoloClean and HoloDetect, which are generative models, SLiMFast is an discriminative model that tries to differentiates unclean data from clean data. While this might work well when there's a lot of labelled training data and the domain knowledge input is 100% accurate, the result is not at all reliable if the domain knowledge input is not accurate, since you'll be putting more confidence in data that could be wrong. In general, I am not convinced that this is a good way to repair data.
