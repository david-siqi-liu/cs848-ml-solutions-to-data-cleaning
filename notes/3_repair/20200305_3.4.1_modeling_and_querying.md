7. Justification of Decision (one paragraph)

This paper introduces a probabilistic model that is able to lossly represent possible sets of repairs given by hierarchical clustering algorithm. The implementation is done in traditional RDBMs such as PostgreSQL. While both the hierarchical clustering algorithm and SQL are considered relatively out-of-date currently, it was simple and effective. However, if there are too many records, there could be many "distinct end points" when querying and that would yield many probabilities. Nevertheless, it was novel and simple, while introducing the idea of uncertainty in data deduplication.
