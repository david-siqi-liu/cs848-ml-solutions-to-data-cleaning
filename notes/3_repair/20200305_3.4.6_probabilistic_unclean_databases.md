7. Justification of Decision (one paragraph)

As the title suggests, this paper provides a general framework for Probabilistic Unclean Databases (PUD). It breaks down the process into three parts: intention, realization and observation. Essentially it boils down to choosing a model that maximizes the (log) likelihood at each stage. In the case of supervised learning, since there's no closed form solution to minimizing the loss, we have to resort to gradient descent. In the case of unsupervised learning, it is not necessarily convex, so gradient descent does not necessarily work. Overall, I find the paper to be highly theoretical, with little technical details. While the presentation is adequate to explain the theories, I give it a weak accept rating since it does not offer enough implementation detail.
